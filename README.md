## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (version 16 or higher)*

If you're on Mac, I recommend installing Node.js using Brew with npm. If you're on Windows, I recommend installing using Chocolatey with npm. Here's a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICysCMwOmcM) if you need more help.

2. Add your OpenAI and Firebase keys:
   ```
   # OpenAI
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

   # Firebase
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=1234567890
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:1234567890:web:abcdef123456
   VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
   ```
   **Note:** Never commit your `.env` file or any of its contents to version control.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API Key Not Working:**
- Ensure your `.env` file is in the root directory
- Verify the API key format: `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here`

**Build Errors:**
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check that you're using Node.js version 16 or higher
- Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

**Development Server Issues:**
- Try a different port: `npm run dev -- --port 3000`
- Clear browser cache and restart the dev server
